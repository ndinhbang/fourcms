Runway gives you the ability to display & manage your Eloquent models in Statamic.

- GraphQL API

## Documentation

Visit the [Runway website](https://runway.duncanmcclean.com/) to read the documentation & knowledge base articles.

## Support

Runway is a free addon, because of this there is no direct support channel. If you have a feature request or experience a bug, please [open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/duncanmcclean/runway/issues/new/choose) and it'll be looked into over the next week or two.

> Only the latest version of this addon is supported. If you open a bug report using an old version, your issue will be closed.

## Sponsor me!

Some of my addons (including this one) are free & open-source, meaning you can use them in your site without buying any licenses.

However, there is a cost from my perspective to maintain this addon (fixing new bugs, adding new features, answering questions). That all takes time. I've spent over **88 hours** of my own time maintaining this addon over the past year.

If you use this software on your projects & can afford it, I'd appreciate it if you'd consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/duncanmcclean), even if it's just a couple dollars a month.
